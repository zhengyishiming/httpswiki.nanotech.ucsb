<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary"><span class="mw-headline-number">1</span> Summary</span></h2>
<p>While working in the Nanofab, you are surrounded by hazardous chemicals and gases, high voltages, radiation, and mechanical systems. It is impossible to define a policy for every conceivable situation.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
</p><p><b>The responsibility lies with users and staff to act in a professional, courteous, and safe manner at all times while in the facility.</b> The Nanofab culture relies on self-discipline to follow policies, respect for each other, and careful considerate treatment of facility property that is needed for project success.&#160;Everyone’s work is equally important and the basic rule of treating others how you would like to be treated sets the framework for many policies in the facility.&#160;&#160;As a group we expect all users and staff to help maintain the safety and integrity of the Nanofab.&#160;&#160;
</p><p>The Nanofab is not a teaching lab or a course in processing. The users are expected to have prior cleanroom experience and understand any chemistry or process used. All users should employ common sense and a high degree of prudence while working in this facility.&#160;&#160;&#160;Users violating the operating and safety rules of the facility or endangering the safety of themselves or other users may be denied further access to the facility.
</p><p>This document attempts to define acceptable actions and behavior for the users of the Nanofabrication facility and contains extensive safety related information on common hazards and work practices and procedures within the facility.&#160;

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lab_Suspensions"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.5</span> Lab Suspensions</span></h3>
<p>The lab has been operating for many years. Over this time it has been determined that there exist some fundamental rules and procedures that must be maintained to provide both a safe and productive environment. While it does not happen often and we do not want to prevent users from completing their work we have found that suspensions from the lab are sometimes necessary and must be taken seriously. The lab relies on an honor system as staff can’t be there at all times to maintain compliance. While working in the lab, we rely on users to follow all written and oral procedures (even if inconvenient) and to treat others with respect, honoring both the person and their work as you would your own. The lab has a large user base of more than 600 active users annually.  Most infractions have warnings first and this is most often all that is needed.&#160; The goal of suspensions is to change behavior to conform to the rules and policies set forth in this document.&#160; Suspension durations will escalate until behaviors are changed to conform to the facility rules.&#160; Continued refusal to follow the facility policies and guidelines may result in eventual expulsion from facility use.&#160; PPE and other human safety violations at the wet benches should be expected to result in an immediate suspension.&#160; The duration of any suspension and any further escalation will be determined by the laboratory management after consideration of the events.&#160;&#160;At the exclusive discretion of the operational director, in addition to or in lieu of suspension, we may require a re-reading of this policy and the taking of a refresher quiz for violations.&#160;<b>We will contact your PI or supervisor to acknowledge any suspension</b>.&#160;Please be aware of this policy.&#160;If you are found in non-compliance with any policy it is your fault alone and no one else’s. You should handle this in the appropriate manner and correct your own behavior.&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>The Iris Camera and Card Access System provides security to the Nanofab, and allows tracking of the time each user spends in the Nanofab.&#160;<b>Always scan in when entering the lab and scan out when exiting the lab, even when attending training sessions or performing beneficial work.</b>&#160;&#160;The only exception to this rule is entering as a visitor as defined in the visitor policy below.&#160; <b>Willful Violation this policy will result in suspension.</b>&#160;&#160;This policy is both for safety (knowing who is in the lab in case of emergencies) and for fair, accurate billing of facility resources.&#160;
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Visitor_Policy"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7</span> Visitor Policy&#160;</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Badges"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.1</span> Badges</span></h4>
<p>Visitor badges can be obtained from the staff during the normal weekday hours and removes any confusion about the shadowing of another user without logging in. As a nonpaying person, a visitor can’t touch any equipment, computers or chemicals in the lab. We offer this policy as a courtesy so please do not abuse it as it can also be removed. The visitor badge must be worn outside the bunnysuit and be clearly visible at all times.&#160;&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Shadowing"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.2</span> Shadowing</span></h4>
<p>We encourage new users to shadow current users as a visitor to become familiar with the Nanofab before beginning actual work. To accomplish this, registered users may come in as visitors, with a badge, in order to watch and learn how processes are done.&#160;&#160;A logged-in user and visitor may not exchange roles while in the cleanroom together. Only the actively logged-in user may operate/touch/use any equipment in the laboratory. No exceptions.&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Visiting_Researchers"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.3</span> Visiting Researchers</span></h4>
<p>Professional, non-registered visitors such as research collaborators or new students in a research group can be brought into the lab to observe with the permission of laboratory staff during normal operating hours (8am-5pm M-F).&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Off-hours permission to bring in professional visitors will be evaluated on request by the operational director or co-manager.&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-professional_visitors"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.4</span> Non-professional visitors</span></h4>
<p>Non-professional visitors such as family members and friends can be brought into the lab during normal hours (8am-5pm M-F) only with permission of the operational director or co-manager.&#160;&#160;In general, these types of visits can be most effectively done looking through the windows of the long South hallway.&#160;&#160;&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Visitor_Rules"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.5</span> Visitor Rules</span></h4>
<p>Any official user can bring in a visitor in to the Nanofab under the guidelines given above to observe the lab operation.&#160;The official user is wholly accountable for the visitor’s safety, correct gowning and adherence to the visitor policy. Please do not take this privilege lightly as we don’t want anyone to be injured while in the lab as a visitor.&#160;&#160;&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Groups"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.6</span> Groups</span></h4>
<p>Any “group” tour (3 or more people) inside the facility needs prior approval of the operational director or co-manager. Please give ample time when requesting.&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Violations"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.7.7</span> Violations</span></h4>
<p>The Nanofab relies on the honor system and the visitor “observation only” policy is clear. <b>If users are caught violating the visitor policy and operating/handling anything in the lab while being a visitor both the official user host and the visitor will be suspended from the lab without exception.</b>

<p>You can receive a time credit for each hour of beneficial time given to the facility.&#160; The time you are in the lab for the beneficial time is subtracted from the invoice and an additional benefit of 0.5 hours for each hour is given as a credit.  Beneficial time includes:
</p>
<ol><li>performing maintenance on lab equipment,</li>
<li>conducting training sessions for other groups (not for your own research group), or</li>
<li>any time spent performing work beneficial to the general operation of the lab.</li></ol>
<p>Please indicate time spent performing beneficial work on the sign-up sheet just inside the gowning room, with a description of what you did/who you worked with.&#160; The lab director will ultimately determine if the credit is given.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Determining_Nanofab_beneficial_lab_time_credit"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.8.2</span> Determining Nanofab beneficial lab time credit</span></h4>
<p>The two common ways for logging beneficial time:&#160;&#160;
</p>
<ol><li>If you help staff with Nanofab related work such as maintenance, construction or cleanup of equipment or the lab.&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>If you happen to help/train someone outside of your group, unplanned, while you are logged in to the Nanofab. Please review the below paragraphs to understand other situations.&#160;&#160;&#160;</li></ol>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Training_within_your_group"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.8.3</span> Training within your group</span></h4>
<p>When you are training a group member or any other user, the correct way to enter the Nanofab is to log in and then take the user in as a visitor with a Visitor Badge. We assume that you are training while you are performing your own work and the other user is <u>only observing</u>. Only one user can be using the equipment and that user should be charged for their use.&#160;&#160;

<p>Leave all workspaces (wet benches, table tops, and system work surfaces, etc.)&#160;<b>clean</b>,&#160;<b>dry, and organized</b>.&#160;&#160;This includes cleaning up all spills and residues, storing glassware and chemicals, throwing away used wipes and Aluminum dishes, etc. 
</p><p>If a workspace is not clean&#160;when you start a task, you still have the responsibility to leave it clean.&#160;
</p><p><b>If you leave any workspace in disarray, or leave an unlabeled container on any workspace, you can be suspended from the Nanofab.</b>&#160;Please kindly remind other users to clean up after themselves if you see them leaving a mess and to label their containers when needed.&#160;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wet_Benches"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.9.2</span> Wet Benches</span></h4>
<p>For wet benches in particular:&#160;&#160;Do not cover the exhaust holes on the bench tops with wipes or foil, as this will impede the laminar flow of air through the bench and possibly expose you or other Nanofab users to toxic fumes. Glassware may be left to dry on the racks or, for large containers, at the back of the bench only while you are working in the lab. When you leave the lab, you are responsible for drying and putting away all of your glassware. A user’s job in the facility is not complete until all user-specific materials have been cleaned up and put away.&#160; 
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Glassware_Confiscation_Policy"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.9.2.1</span> Glassware Confiscation Policy</span></h5>
<p>Glassware left out to dry after you leave the lab for the day may be confiscated and put into a secure location for a time, before being disposed of. &#160;The group/user name will be placed on a list in the facility that users can check to determine if their materials have been taken by staff. &#160;The current location for this list is on the cabinet in service chase 4, and all Staff have key-access to this cabinet.  
</p><p>Make sure your glassware/wafer holders have a group name written on them. &#160;Items with no user or group name are subject to disposal. If you ask staff to retrieve your glassware and it is found, your PI/advisor/supervisor will be charged a fee of 30 minutes of staff time and this will be noted on the invoice.&#160; For continued violations there will be an escalation of consequences:
</p><p>1<sup>st</sup> offense: fee
</p><p>2<sup>nd</sup> offense within 12 months:&#160; fee 
</p><p>3<sup>rd</sup> time offense within 12 months:&#160; fee and warning of impending suspension

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Notes_on_Particle_Counts_in_the_Nanofab"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.14</span> Notes on Particle Counts in the Nanofab</span></h3>
<ol><li>The Nanofab has historically been surveyed with a particle counter, with generally good results.&#160;All laminar flow, wet bench work surfaces have extremely low particle counts, better than class 10. The open areas in the lithography area are all better than class 100, and mostly better than class 10. The remainder of the Nanofab tests better than class 1000, and often better than class 100. The Nanofab design specifications stipulated class 100 for litho, class 1000 for everything else. The Nanofab is easily meeting these specs.&#160;&#160;</li>
<li><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:99px;"><a href="File_Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.html" class="image"><img alt="Lab Rules - 1.14.2 face masks.png" src="../w/images/thumb/1/1d/Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png/97px-Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png" decoding="async" width="97" height="129" class="thumbimage" srcset="/w/images/thumb/1/1d/Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png/146px-Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png 1.5x, /w/images/1/1d/Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.png 2x" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Lab_Rules_-_1.14.2_face_masks.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div>The effectiveness of facemasks was investigated by placing the particle counter directly under a person’s neck while the person moved his head back and forth. Facemasks reduced particle counts, from the equivalent of class 500 without masks to class 100 with masks.&#160;&#160;Again, this was sampling just below the neck, not at typical substrate surfaces. If you need to inspect your parts very close to your face for any reason, you should consider using a face mask.&#160;&#160;There are two types of facemasks provided in the gowning room. Please choose the appropriate mask for your requirements.&#160;</li>
<li>The choice of wipes used in the Nanofab has a more pronounced effect on particle counts.&#160;&#160;In general, wipes trade absorbency for low particle generation. The Spec-Wipe 3 is the stocked polyester/cellulose blend, high absorbency wipe designed for use in class 100 cleanrooms. Dragging the sampling tube across the surface of a Spec-Wipe 3 resulted in a class 1000 level particle counts. The Berkshire Polx 1200 wipe is the stocked low particle count, 100% knit polyester wipe. This wipe is far less absorbent than the Spec-Wipe 3, but generates fewer particles.&#160;&#160;Dragging the sampling tube across the surface of a Berkshire Polx 1200 wipe resulted in lower than class 100 level particle counts. The main point to note is that abrasion of fabric surfaces results in higher particle counts. When processing, try not to scrape the wipes while handling your parts.&#160;</li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Procedure_for_the_Use_and_Handling_of_Precious_Metals"><span class="mw-headline-number">2.15</span> Procedure for the Use and Handling of Precious Metals</span></h3>
<ol><li>All precious metals (as well as other materials paid for by the Nanofab) are the property of the Nanofab. They are not to be used for any other purpose than for use within Nanofab systems.&#160; The materials must remain in the Nanofab at all times.</li>
<li>Gold, platinum, palladium, and various alloys of these metals are stocked by the UCSB Nanofab and are provided for in the hourly recharge fee. Each research group can be issued a precious metal supply.&#160;&#160;You should check with your group first before contacting the Nanofab.&#160;&#160;Please contact the Nanofab Director for precious metals,&#160;thibeault@ece.ucsb.edu.<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:91px;"><a href="File_Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.html" class="image"><img alt="Lab Rules - 1.15.2 metals lock box.png" src="../w/images/thumb/5/53/Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.png/89px-Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.png" decoding="async" width="89" height="121" class="thumbimage" srcset="/w/images/5/53/Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.png 1.5x" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Lab_Rules_-_1.15.2_metals_lock_box.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li>
<li>This supply must be stored in a small lockable container, along with a log sheet for recording the use of these metals. Precious metals, the lockable security container, and log sheets will be issued by the Nanofab manager. All use of precious metals must be accurately recorded on the log sheet, and include user name, date, metal type, metal weight before use, and metal weight after use.&#160;<b>Any discrepancies, such as over use or loss of the precious metals will be invoiced to the responsible group/company. Loss of a precious metal lock box will be reported to the local UCSB police and will elevate the issue as this is considered theft and a considerable amount of money.</b>Please make sure you are careful with your metal supply as you would be with your own money.&#160;</li>
<li>Every group is responsible for keeping their supply of precious metals up to date and full. But since all users are sharing the same lab supply of provided metals it is fine to share metals between groups if there are extenuating circumstances that prevented a group from having sufficient precious metal supply. It must be correctly noted in the other group’s log sheets that metal was used.<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:153px;"><a href="File_Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.html" class="image"><img alt="Lab Rules - 1.15.4 metals weighing scale.png" src="../w/images/thumb/c/c7/Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.png/151px-Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.png" decoding="async" width="151" height="144" class="thumbimage" srcset="/w/images/c/c7/Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.png 1.5x" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="File_Lab_Rules_-_1.15.4_metals_weighing_scale.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div></div></div></div></li>
<li>Multiple digital scales have been acquired and placed throughout the Nanofab to facilitate weighing of these metals. When requesting additional precious metals, the completed log sheet must be presented to the Nanofab manager. Any discrepancies or loss in recorded precious metal use will result in charges to the principle investigator/company corresponding to the value of the precious metal missing.&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>Any loose precious metal lock boxes left out or any loose unmarked precious metals found in the lab either in a plastic bags, tins or individually laying on the floor should be returned to the lab manager for reclaim.&#160;</li></ol>

<p>Human and equipment safety is very important in the Nanofab. &#160;The Nanofab uses a full facility 24-hour camera recording system to improve safety within the laboratory.&#160; Up to 14 days of footage is recorded on 18 cameras.&#160; This recorded footage is regularly checked at various locations for safety violations.&#160; The footage may also used when violations of safety and policy are reported by users.  Users observed to be violating policies on the recordings will be contacted by the management for further discussions.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_Trained_on_Equipment"><span class="mw-headline-number">3.1</span> Getting Trained on Equipment</span></h3>
<p>The systems in the nanofabrication facility require operational training before authorization.&#160;&#160;Please contact tool owners for training as indicated on signupmonkey (described later) or on the lab wiki.&#160;&#160;During training on a piece of equipment, users should take notes and pay attention to all instructions given.&#160;&#160;Many systems have basic operating procedures to remind you of operation, but may not contain all of the information you need to successfully operate the system. Users are responsible for following written and oral instructions for the equipment. If you are unsure about any aspect of operation of a system after training, please ask the engineer or senior users of the equipment for assistance. Please do not be embarrassed to ask for more details about training. It is much more important to understand the systems as we want to prevent failures. Some operation failures will prevent many users from being able to finish their work, take systems down for extended periods, and cost the lab money for repairing the damage to the tool. Occasionally we will need to share the cost of the repair with the group/company that damaged the system, if pure negligence is determined as the cause.&#160;&#160;
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Machine_sign-up_and_use"><span class="mw-headline-number">3.2</span> Machine sign-up and use</span></h3>
<p>Most systems require web-based sign-up.&#160;&#160;(http://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu,see below) for reservations.&#160;&#160;
</p>
<ol><li>There is a 15 minute grace period for you to use your time slot or someone else is allowed to use the system. If you don’t show for your time slot then any user can take all of your consecutive time slots not just that specific slot.  It is the registered user's responsibility to make sure there is a note at the tool if they will show up later than 15 minutes before the beginning of their time slot in order to prevent another user from taking the reservation times for themselves on the system.</li>
<li>If you show up to a system and the scheduled user is not there, but you want to use the system, you need to first attempt to contact the user.&#160; Phone numbers and emails are accessible on signupmonkey.&#160; You should also look around the lab to see if the person is present as they may be doing something like etch/characterization cycles that require them to step away from the system for short times.  Only after making reasonable effort to contact the user may you take the slots at the 15-minute mark after the start of the reservation. &#160;</li>
<li>Schedule enough time for all procedures you need to perform so that you will not encroach on the next user’s time slot. This includes all pre-and post-cleaning of the tools, where applicable.&#160;<b>This is every user’s responsibility and will result in suspensions if you abuse the system.</b>&#160;&#160;The next user is not responsible for your scheduling issues.&#160;Do not take “extra” slots to buffer around your schedule, instead give yourself adequate time between process steps to accommodate difficulties.&#160;&#160;The Nanofab staff tracks and resolves non-shows and users that abuse the system.&#160;</li>
<li>It is mandatory to fill in the appropriate information in the log books for each piece of equipment in the lab. This is often the only record of actual use and is necessary for any troubleshooting of equipment issues.&#160;<b>Willful non-compliance or repeated failures will result in suspensions.</b></li></ol>

<p>Contact information for each responsible staff engineer is found directly above the tool, on signupmonkey, or on the wiki page. There is also a general mail list,&#160;nanofab@ece.ucsb.eduto all cleanroom staff for general questions or problems. The staff engineer will give training and post procedures for tool operation. Without proper training or posted procedures, users may not clear out errors or try undocumented procedures to get samples out of machines.&#160;They must contact the responsible engineer for assistance.&#160;&#160;All errors and issues must be entered in the tool log books.&#160;&#160;&#160;
</p>
<ol><li>All issues, whether or not they are your fault, need to be propmptly reported to the system engineer.&#160;Mistakes are tolerated and may result in required retraining, but&#160;<b>hiding mistakes is immediate grounds for lab suspension.</b></li>
<li><b>System Alarms</b>: If a system alarms, the responsible engineer should be contacted for assistance, either by cell phone if at a reasonable time or by email. Do not attempt to fix the problem unless you have training from the responsible engineer. Sometimes after normal staff working hours machines will be down until the next working day. Please note in the log books that there is a problem with the tool and that the staff has been contacted.</li>
<li><b>Software problems:</b>&#160;Unless written directions are given at the system or training given by the responsible engineer, contact the system engineer by phone and email regarding software problems. Do not restart the computer unless instructed to do so.</li>
<li>When the engineer cannot be reached immediately by phone, please use the “<b>Report Tool Issue</b>” button in signupmonkey to report the issue so that the nanofab staff and subsequent users will be made aware of the issue.&#160; For tools not on signupmonkey, send email to [<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="Mailto:nanofab@ece.ucsb.edu%7Cnanofab@ece.ucsb.edu">[1]</a>] to report problems in case the tool engineer cannot be reached quickly.</li></ol>

<li>The nine built-in PR baking hotplates are preset at certain temperatures. They should not be changed unless you are directed by Nanofab staff. There are other freestanding hotplates to be used for custom temperatures. Please contact staff if you have any questions.</li>
<li>Every group/company should have a temperature measuring device (thermometer, thermocouple or bi-metal sensor) to check hotplate temperatures.  We check and calibrate the built-in, lift-pin, and the large wafer round hotplates weekly.  But hotplates can fail or users may wrongly change standard temperatures so every user is accountable for verifying hotplate temperature before use. Please contact staff,&#160;hopkins@ece.ucsb.eduor&#160;day@ece.ucsb.eduwhen hotplates have failed or are out of specifications.</li>
<li>The hotplates cannot be reserved. Please be conscientious about your hotplate use.&#160;Everyone needs to use them often so if you have a unique process that requires long baking or heating, contact Nanofab staff for a long term solution.</li>
<li>All heated beaker chemistry must be covered by a watch glass or some type of cover (foil or custom cover). You can cut handles of wafer/piece carriers to be below the beaker cover or notch them to have a handle protrude thru the cover.&#160;<b>There are no exceptions to this rule.</b></li>
<li>Heated chemicals are more reactive and hot plates should be kept towards the back of the benches to minimize the possibility of being knocked over accidently and to minimize the possibility of exposure if a beaker breaks/cracks or is spilled while heated.&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>Please leave hotplates in a clean condition.&#160;&#160;Do not contaminate the hotplate surface with solders, resists, low melting point metals or any other material that would jeopardize other user’s materials. It is every user’s responsibility to clean or check hotplates before and after use for any issues.&#160;&#160;A few extra minutes of cleaning up after ourselves makes the lab a better place for everyone to work.&#160;</li></ol>

<p>In the case that a lab fire arises at any bench or piece of equipment, immediately hit the Emergency Power Off (EPO) button for the bench/equipment.  You may then grab a fire extinguisher and put out the small fire.  Halotron fire extinguishers are located on the south end of each clean bay, and the north end of each maintenance chase. Halotron is rated as an ABC extinguisher. It is used on electronic equipment because it leaves no residue. You are not required to extinguish a fire, but if you are confident and have been trained in the use of a fire extinguisher, then it is a subjective decision to fight a small fire.  If in doubt, hit the emergency off for the affected bench or equipment, immediately pull fire alarm and exit building.

<p>All chemicals, compounds, gases, materials for evaporation, etc., must be approved by the Nanofab manager before introduction into the facility.&#160;&#160;In order to introduce a new material into the Nanofab, a SDS (Safety Data Sheet) for the material in .pdf format must be submitted to the Nanofab manager, along with any anticipated processes involving the new material.&#160;&#160;The SDS contains safety information regarding exposure, first aid, handling, storage, fire hazard, other chemical incompatibilities, etc., for all chemicals, gases, and materials present in the facility.&#160;&#160;Before using an unfamiliar material, consult the SDS to determine any potential hazards. Consult the SDS to determine the proper course of action if someone has been exposed to a gas or chemical, or a spill has occurred. Binders containing the SDS for any material used in the Nanofab is located just inside the gowning room.&#160;&#160;Additionally, an electronic version of the (M)SDS in .pdf format for all chemicals in our inventory is located on our wiki page. Quick google searches on internet connected devices can also bring up SDS’s rather quickly.&#160;
</p><p>All users are expected to read and understand the SDS (Safety Data Sheets) for all chemicals they use in the facility, even if the usage or process has been passed down from previous group members.  Users that understand the dangers and incompatibilities of the chemicals they work with are safer users.&#160; Users should also understand how to mix chemicals properly to avoid potential exothermic reactions.&#160; It is the responsibility of the user and their PI to make sure chemicals are mixed and used in a safe manner and that proper PPE is worn for the chemicals being used.&#160; Users may contact the facility management for guidance if unsure of proper chemical use and handling for given chemicals.

<p>Most (but not all) water-based chemicals use this method. All liquid waste from the plastic benches is collected in pump lift stations behind the benches in the service chases. These lift stations pump the waste chemicals overhead to an acid waste neutralization (AWN) system located outside of the Nanofab in the mechanical room where the chemical waste is treated for pH and then drained to the sewer.&#160;&#160;This is the primary drain in the Nanofab.&#160;&#160;All liquids entering the sink drain at any polypropylene wet bench in the Nanofab run through this treatment system. To dispose of an acid or base, pour the liquid down the drain, rinse and drain glassware 3 times, use the sprayer to dilute the mixture in the sink while draining,&#160;&#160;and use the plenum flush to help dilute/rinse the chemical into the lift stations (especially for concentrated acid mixtures).&#160;&#160;There are also venturi aspirators at the&#160;
</p><p>back of all acid/base benches to pump the chemistry from larger beakers so that you do not have to pick them up and pour them in to the sinks.&#160;&#160;When using this technique, always use the plenum flush and rinse your beakers when done.&#160;&#160;<b>Do not pour the liquid thru the perforated tops</b>. If you spill an acid or base onto the top surface of a bench, first rinse the surface thoroughly with water using the DI sprayers, then turn on the plenum flush to rinse the bench drain.&#160;&#160;<b>Do not pour solvents down the acid drain</b>.&#160;

<p>Waste solvents are poured into the solvent dumps at the back of each solvent bench. Most (but not all) solvent waste uses this method.&#160;<b>Do not pour the liquid thru the perforated tops.Do not pour waste over the POLOS spinners</b>. The solvent drain waste is collected in a pump lift station in the service chases.&#160;&#160;The lift stations pump when full to a storage tank located in the Nanofab mechanical room.&#160;The waste solvents are transported to the EH&amp;S chemical waste processing facility and are properly disposed.&#160;<b>Do not use acids or bases at the solvent benches</b>.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Collection_of_chemical_waste"><span class="mw-headline-number">8.12.2.3</span> Collection of chemical waste</span></h5>
<p>Some chemicals require collection according to state regulations.&#160;&#160;When this is the case, always fill out the Environmental Health and Safety waste disposal tags that are provided at the waste cabinet in service chase 5.&#160;&#160;Fill out each tag with the appropriate information when disposing of collected chemical waste.&#160;&#160;EH&amp;S will only remove properly labeled waste bags and containers.&#160;&#160;Nanofab staff can assist with this process.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Communications_and_Internet_Access"><span class="mw-headline-number">10</span> Communications and Internet Access</span></h2>
<p>The basic approach to lab communications is that the Nanofab staff/management must be able to contact every user of the lab. All user emails and phone numbers must be current.&#160;<b>If the Nanofab can’t communicate with you then you can’t enter/use the lab.</b> Most of our systems will automatically remove you from the lab if your email bounces. If that happens then your access will be shut off to enter the lab.&#160;<b>This is the user’s responsibility to make sure the contact info is correct and up to date</b>.&#160;
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Process_Equipment_Scheduling"><span class="mw-headline-number">10.1</span> Process Equipment Scheduling</span></h3>
<p>The majority of the processing tools in the Nanofab are scheduled through a web-based equipment scheduling system known as “<b>signup monkey</b>”.&#160;&#160;Anyone with Nanofab access can view the site, but only users who have completed training on a tool will be able to schedule use of that tool.&#160;&#160;The site address is:&#160;
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu/">http://signupmonkey.ece.ucsb.edu</a>. Once you have been trained by the specific staff engineer in charge of a system then you will be able to reserve time on the tool through signupmonkey.&#160;
</p><p>There is more information about the system on our wiki page:&#160;<a href="Main_Page.html" title="Main Page">https://wiki.nanotech.ucsb.edu/w/index.php?title=Main_Page.</a>
</p>
<ol><li><b>Script writing for tool sign-up is forbidden</b>.&#160;&#160;<b>Users caught trying to run scripts will be suspended from the cleanroom without exception.</b></li>
<li>Users must sign up for all tools on signup monkey before use. The only exception is when another user did not show up for their timeslot and you take it<b>.</b></li>
<li>Only trained/authorized users may operate process equipment. The tool owner is responsible for this training.&#160;<b>Users will be suspended without exception for using equipment they are not authorized to use</b>.&#160;</li></ol>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Saving_Data_in_the_NanoFab"><span class="mw-headline-number">10.2</span> Saving Data in the NanoFab</span></h3>
<p>The Nanofab does not allow USB memory sticks for saving electronic files.&#160;USB ports are disabled on most computers to prevent the spread of viruses. Instead, you can download your files from our SFTP server, Nanofiles. As long as you place your files into the proper folder on the computer, your files will be synced to the&#160;<b>Nanofiles STFP server</b>every hour (or immediately by running the "<i>Sync to NanoFiles</i>" script). For instructions on how to access these files, and where to place your files, please log into your&#160;<b>SignupMonkey</b> account and click the “here” link under <b>Files</b>&#160;on the front page as shown below. The email you receive will give you instructions on accessing/syncing to the&#160;<b>Nanofiles server</b>.&#160;
